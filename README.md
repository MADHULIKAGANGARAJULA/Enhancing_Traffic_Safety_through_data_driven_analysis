# Enhancing_Traffic_Safety_through_data_driven_analysis
This project aimed at improving road safety in Los Angeles by analyzing traffic accident data from 2010 to the present. It describes the data lifecycle from generation and collection to storage and analysis using tools like Google Cloud Platform, Hadoop, BigQuery, and Spark. The study identifies key factors contributing to traffic accidents, such as high-crime locations (77th Street), peak accident times (Fridays), and vulnerable age groups (20-60). Data visualization through charts and graphs supports these insights, emphasizing the need for targeted safety measures, awareness campaigns, and infrastructure improvements. The project highlights the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in enhancing traffic safety and informing policy decisions.
